# Welcome to Bmixjs!

This is a boilerplate of a simple Bmixjs app using the Bmixjs App Server.

- [Bmixjs Docs](https://bmix.dev/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

or

```shell
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

or

```shell
yarn start
```
